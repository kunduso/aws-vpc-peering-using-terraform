# aws-vpc-peering-using-terraform
## Motivation
A few weeks ago, I created a peering relationship between two VPCs that belonged to separate AWS accounts using Terraform. This repository contains the terraform configuration files to configure that.
<br/> Details are available on my notes at [VPC Peering using Terraform across separate AWS accounts.](https://skundunotes.com/2021/08/24/vpc-peering-using-terraform-across-separate-aws-accounts/)
